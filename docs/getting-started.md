# Getting Started with the Internal Developer Platform

## Overview

Welcome to our Internal Developer Platform (IDP)! This platform provides a unified interface for managing applications, infrastructure, deployments, and team collaboration in a modern DevOps environment.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18+ 
- Docker Desktop
- Git
- kubectl (for Kubernetes management)

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/company/idp-platform
   cd idp-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Core Concepts

### Services
Services are the building blocks of your application. Each service represents a microservice or component that can be deployed independently.

### Environments
Environments represent different stages of your deployment pipeline (development, staging, production).

### Pipelines
CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment process for your services.

### Infrastructure
Infrastructure resources include servers, databases, storage, and networking components.

## Navigation

The platform is organized into several main sections:

- **Dashboard**: Overview of system health and recent activity
- **Service Catalog**: Manage and monitor all your services
- **Environments**: Configure and manage deployment environments
- **Infrastructure**: Monitor and provision infrastructure resources
- **Pipelines**: Set up and manage CI/CD workflows
- **Documentation**: Access guides, API references, and runbooks
