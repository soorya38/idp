# Platform Architecture

## System Overview

The Internal Developer Platform follows a microservices architecture with event-driven communication patterns. This document outlines the high-level architecture, key components, and design decisions.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. API-First Design
All services expose well-defined REST APIs with OpenAPI specifications. This ensures consistent interfaces and enables easy integration.

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
Services communicate asynchronously through message queues and event streams, reducing coupling and improving resilience.

### 3. Container-Native
All components are containerized and orchestrated using Kubernetes, providing scalability and portability.

### 4. Observability by Design
Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing are built into every component from the ground up.

### 5. Security by Default
Zero-trust security model with authentication, authorization, and encryption at every layer.

## Core Components

### Frontend Layer
- **Web Application**: React-based dashboard for platform management
- **API Gateway**: Kong-based gateway for request routing and security
- **Load Balancer**: NGINX for traffic distribution

### Application Layer
- **Service Catalog**: Service discovery and metadata management
- **Environment Manager**: Environment lifecycle and configuration
- **Pipeline Engine**: CI/CD workflow orchestration
- **Infrastructure Controller**: Resource provisioning and management
- **Notification Service**: Multi-channel notification delivery

### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for application data
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **InfluxDB**: Time-series metrics storage
- **Elasticsearch**: Log aggregation and search

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Docker Registry**: Container image storage
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Monitoring dashboards

## Data Flow

### Service Deployment Flow
1. Developer pushes code to Git repository
2. Webhook triggers pipeline in Pipeline Engine
3. Pipeline builds and tests the application
4. Successful builds create container images
5. Images are stored in Docker Registry
6. Environment Manager deploys to target environment
7. Service Catalog updates service metadata
8. Monitoring systems begin tracking the new deployment

### Monitoring Data Flow
1. Applications emit metrics to Prometheus
2. Logs are collected by Fluentd and sent to Elasticsearch
3. Distributed traces are sent to Jaeger
4. Grafana queries data sources for visualization
5. Alert Manager processes alerts and sends notifications

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Identity Provider**: OAuth 2.0/OIDC integration
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control
- **API Keys**: Service-to-service authentication

### Network Security
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for mTLS and traffic policies
- **Network Policies**: Kubernetes network segmentation
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall for external traffic
- **VPN**: Secure administrative access

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault integration
- **Data Classification**: Automated PII detection and handling

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- All services are designed to scale horizontally
- Stateless application design
- Database read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Auto-scaling based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics

### Performance Optimization
- CDN for static assets
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies at multiple layers
- Asynchronous processing for heavy operations

### Capacity Planning
- Resource monitoring and alerting
- Predictive scaling based on historical data
- Load testing and performance benchmarking
- Cost optimization through right-sizing

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Automated daily database backups
- Cross-region backup replication
- Container image backup and versioning
- Configuration backup in Git repositories

### High Availability
- Multi-zone deployment
- Database clustering with automatic failover
- Load balancer health checks
- Circuit breakers for external dependencies

### Recovery Procedures
- Documented runbooks for common scenarios
- Automated recovery for infrastructure failures
- Data recovery procedures and testing
- Business continuity planning

## Technology Stack

### Languages & Frameworks
- **Backend**: Node.js, Go, Python
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
